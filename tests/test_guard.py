"""Tests for the hold-out guard — the structural boundary every improve agent runs behind.

The guard is pure (:func:`find_test_access`), so the three things it must deny are checked
directly: the test split of any task, every split of a held-out task (a CV fold), and any denied
directory (the lockbox, other folds). Paths reach it as structured fields or as tokens of a shell
command, and both routes are covered.
