"""Shared fixtures for the acumen test suite.

The suite is deliberately small and offline: it covers the CLI's main commands and the
pure helpers underneath them, and never spawns an agent. Anything that would call the
Claude Agent SDK (``draft``, ``improve``, ``tasks``, ``ship``) is only exercised up to
the pre-flight checks that run *before* the agent — those are the parts a unit test can
honestly assert.
