    ----------
    key
        Identifies the run; also determines ``run_dir`` upstream.
    task
        The task being run; ``key.split`` selects which half.
    target
        The prepared target, supplying the interpreter and fingerprint.
    run_dir
        Where the five run files are written.
    model, max_turns, max_usd
        Already resolved against per-task overrides by the caller.
    auth_mode
        Which credential benchmark runs authenticate with; always ``"api"`` so the recorded
        ``cost_usd`` reflects real metered spend.
    skill
        The skill to install, or ``None`` for the baseline arm. Must agree with
        ``key.arm``, else the run would be filed under an arm it doesn't belong to.
    skill_name
        Name of the skill under test, used to recognise it in the transcript. Defaults to
        the installed skill's name; pass it in the baseline arm too, where nothing is
        installed but a stray load of that same skill is exactly what must be caught.
        Without either, ``skill_loaded`` is left ``None`` — unattributable, not absent.
    sandbox_base
        Parent directory for the throwaway sandbox.
    keep_sandbox
        Leave the sandbox on disk — useful when hand-checking a failure.
    stderr
        Callback for the CLI subprocess's stderr, one line at a time. Pass a shared
        :class:`StderrFilter` across a pass to collapse the per-spawn startup warnings;
        ``None`` (the default) lets the subprocess stderr inherit the terminal unfiltered.
    env_passthrough
        Extra environment variable names to carry into the sandbox on top of the built-in
        allowlist (the operator's ``config.env_passthrough``).
    dataset_cache_dirs
        cwd-relative dataset directories to symlink to the target's shared dataset cache
        (``config.dataset_cache_dirs``), identically in both arms.

    Returns
    -------
    The outcome, matching what was written to disk.
