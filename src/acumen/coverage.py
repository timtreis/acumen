"""API coverage: which of the target package's public symbols the task set exercises.

A task set is only a benchmark of the *package* to the extent it touches the package's API.
Two questions this module answers, so generation can be driven toward the gaps rather than
piling more tasks onto the same handful of functions:

* **What could be covered?** :func:`build_inventory` introspects the *installed* package and
  enumerates its public call surface — the dotted names a user actually writes
  (``squidpy.gr.spatial_neighbors``), not the private module a symbol is defined in. This is
  the denominator.
* **What is covered?** :func:`measure_coverage` reads the ground-truth confirmation scripts the
  task-generation agent persisted (one per task, ``scripts/<task_id>.py``) and, by **static AST
  analysis**, records which inventory symbols each script references. The union is the numerator.

Why static analysis and not a runtime tracer: the ground-truth scripts are run *by the agent*
inside a throwaway sandbox, so a ``sys.setprofile`` hook would have to survive that teardown and
would count every exploratory run, not the confirmed pipeline; and re-executing the scripts
ourselves to trace them re-pays the (often minutes-long) pipeline cost purely to learn which names
were called. squidpy analyses are written as direct attribute calls (``sq.gr.spatial_neighbors(...)``),
so an AST scan recovers the referenced symbols essentially perfectly and for free. It is
deliberately *conservative*: a name it cannot resolve statically simply does not count as covered,
which errs toward re-queueing a symbol rather than declaring a gap closed it hasn't.

``inventory − covered`` is the generation queue: the symbols no task exercises yet, which the next
task-generation pass should target.
