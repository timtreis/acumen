"""Aggregate ``result.json`` files into a self-contained HTML report.

The report reads **only** ``result.json`` — never the transcripts. Each result is
the unit of record, so aggregation is just a walk of the run tree, a load per leaf, and a
few group-bys. Figures are matplotlib rendered to PNG and inlined as base64 data URIs, so
``report.html`` opens standalone with no sidecar files and no new dependencies.

The report is regenerated (overwritten) at each skill version — it always reflects every
run currently on disk across every arm.

The visualisations show **test-split** performance — the held-out measure of whether a
skill helps. The full per-run table below them still lists both splits, so train runs
remain inspectable.

    """The metrics grid: one subplot row per skill, one column per metric.

    Every bar is a mean over runs — success rate, skill-load rate, then tokens, cost and
    time per run — each with the standard error of that mean. Reporting the resources per
    run rather than as totals keeps them comparable with the two rates and with each other:
    an arm covering more tasks or more reps no longer looks more expensive for it. Columns
    share an x-axis so skills are comparable within a metric. The load rate is the share of
    runs that loaded the skill under test — the baseline arm is drawn too, where a bar above
    zero means the baseline is not clean.

    Inside each cell, bars are coloured by model, with a final grey bar pooling every model
    at once — where an average run lands overall. When ``split_hue`` is set, train and test
    are shown as two textures (test solid, train hatched) rather than two colours, leaving
    the model hue intact.

    Parameters
    ----------
    df
        Results to plot — the full frame, or one task's slice.
    split_hue
        ``True`` for the per-task view (train + test as texture); ``False`` for the
        overview (the reported test split only).
    colors
        Bar colour per model id, as returned by :func:`resolve_palette`. It may cover more
        models than ``df`` holds — one map resolved over the whole report is reused for
        every per-task figure, so a model keeps its colour across them. Models missing
        from it fall back to their tier default; ``None`` uses the defaults throughout.

    """Skill size against success rate — what each version's bytes buy.

    The metrics grid reports every measure on its own axis, which answers "how much?" but never
    "was it worth it?". This plots success against the one thing a skill author controls — how
    much the agent has to read — so the reader can see whether a version earned its size. Up and
    to the left is better: the same success with less to read. Dollar cost is deliberately *not*
    the axis: it is a property of the model and the run, not of the skill, and it is not something
    acumen optimizes.

    Each model gets its own mark per arm, in the model's colour; each arm also gets a larger grey
    mark pooling every model, carrying a standard error on the rate — the same statistic the
    grid's grey bar reports. Only the pooled marks are labelled; labelling every point would
    collide. Hue stays the *model*, as in every other figure here, so the arm rides a second
    channel: marker shape (see :func:`_arm_marker`). Identity therefore never rests on colour alone.

    A staircase traces the **Pareto frontier** over every mark shown — the combinations nothing
    else beats on both counts at once. Anything below and to the right of it is dominated:
    something on the line is no bigger *and* succeeds more, so there is no reason to choose it.
    The baseline sits at size zero, so it always anchors the frontier's first step. The frontier is
    drawn over the pooled marks as well as the per-model ones, so it really is the outer edge of
    the whole plot and no mark can float above it. An arm whose size is unknown (runs recorded
    before it was tracked, with no skill tree to recover it from) is left off the figure.

    Size is anchored at zero, but the rate axis starts just below the lowest mark rather than at
    zero. Anchoring it too would strand every point in the top third of an otherwise empty panel,
    close enough together to hide the differences the figure exists to show. That is safe here in
    a way it would not be on the grid's bars: position carries the value, not the length of
    anything, the axis is labelled in percent throughout, and the pooled marks show their error
    bars — so a small gap cannot read as a large one.

    correction. *Was it worth its size?* is not a hypothesis test — size is fixed per artifact —

    on the (size, rate) frontier, i.e. no smaller skill matches its rate. Folding the two into one
    score would pick an exchange rate between bytes and success on the reader's behalf, and that

 the skill version; the x-axis is the bytes of skill the agent had to read (the baseline reads
 nothing). The grey mark pools every model for that version, with a standard error on the rate.
 The staircase is the Pareto frontier: anything below and to the right of it is dominated,
 because something on the line is no bigger <em>and</em> succeeds more. Dollar cost is not an
 axis here &mdash; it belongs to the model and the run, not to the skill.</p>

<h3 id="dominance">Is the difference real?</h3>
<p class="task-desc">A version <em>beats</em> the baseline when its success rate is higher by more
 than chance. A gain the resampling cannot tell apart from noise leaves the Holm p high, which
 says the evidence is thin rather than that the version is bad. Size is not tested &mdash; it is a
 fixed property of the artifact, and no skill is leaner than none &mdash; but it is shown as the
 price paid, and <em>On frontier</em> says whether that price was justified: how often, across
 resamples, no smaller skill matches the arm's rate. Best value in each column is
 <strong>bold</strong>, highest for the rates and lowest for size and for the p-values.
 Resampling is over the {tests.n_clusters} test tasks, paired across arms, so the unit is the task
 rather than the run.</p>

    """Aggregate the run tree and render ``report.html``.

    The report is overwritten in place, so it always reflects every run on disk.

    Parameters
    ----------
    runs_root
        The ``runs/`` root to aggregate.
    out_path
        Where to write ``report.html``.
    tasks
        The loaded tasks, if available — used to print each task's prompt under its
        per-task heading.
    skills_root
        The ``skills/`` root, if available — used to render each skill version's rationale
        and its diff against the parent version. When ``None``, the section is omitted.
    palette
        Bar colours keyed by model id, e.g. ``{"claude-opus-5": "#3b7ea1"}``, overriding
        the tier defaults — see :func:`resolve_palette`.

    Returns
    -------
    The rendered :class:`Report` (also written to ``out_path``).
