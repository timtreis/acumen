    One failing run never takes down the pass — :func:`acumen.runner.run_once` records
    agent errors as failed runs rather than raising.

    Parameters
    ----------
    planned
        The runs to execute; already filtered for resume by :func:`pending`.
    target
        The prepared target.
    runs_root
        The ``runs/`` root.
    max_concurrency
        Ceiling on simultaneous agents.
    auth_mode
        Which credential every run authenticates with; benchmark passes always use ``"api"``
        so the recorded ``cost_usd`` reflects real metered spend.
    skill
        The skill every run in this matrix installs, or ``None`` for the baseline. One
        matrix is one arm, so this is a property of the pass rather than of a run.
    skill_name
        Name of the skill under test (``config.skill_name``), used to recognise it in each
        transcript. Pass it in the baseline arm too — nothing is installed there, but a
        baseline run that loads it anyway is the contamination worth catching.
    sandbox_base
        Parent directory for sandboxes.
    keep_sandbox
        Leave sandboxes on disk for inspection.
    stderr
        Callback for each run's CLI subprocess stderr. Pass one shared
        :class:`~acumen.runner.StderrFilter` so the per-spawn startup warnings are
        printed once for the whole pass instead of once per run.
    on_start
        Optional callable invoked with each :class:`PlannedRun` as it is admitted through
        the concurrency gate and begins, for progress output.
    on_done
        Optional callable invoked with each :class:`~acumen.runner.RunOutcome` as it
        lands, for progress output.
    env_passthrough
        Extra environment variable names each run carries into its sandbox on top of the
        built-in allowlist (the operator's ``config.env_passthrough``).
    dataset_cache_dirs
        cwd-relative dataset directories each sandbox symlinks to the target's shared dataset
        cache (``config.dataset_cache_dirs``).

    Returns
    -------
    The outcomes, in completion order.
