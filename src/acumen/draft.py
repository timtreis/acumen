"""The drafting agent: write ``skills/v1/`` from the target package's source.

Unlike a benchmark agent, the drafter reads the target's source — it is documenting
the package, so it needs to see it. It is otherwise held to the same isolation: scrubbed
env, throwaway config dir, no user settings or memories.

The agent writes into a staging directory, not into ``skills/`` directly. Only a skill
that loads and validates is promoted to a version, so a failed or half-finished draft
never leaves a broken ``skills/vN/`` behind — versions are immutable, which means
they must be right the moment they appear.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cfg
        The pass config; supplies ``skill_name`` and ``draft_model``.
    target
        The prepared target, supplying the source checkout and interpreter.
    skills_root
        The ``skills/`` root. The new version is the next unused one.
    auth_mode
        Which credential the drafting agent authenticates with — ``"session"`` (the Claude
        subscription) or ``"api"`` (see :func:`acumen.env.build_agent_env`).
    model
        Override for the drafting model; defaults to the config's.
    max_turns, max_usd
        Turn and budget caps for the drafting agent. **Unbounded by default** — the config's
        ``max_turns``/``max_usd`` cap benchmark agents only; pass explicit caps to bound the
        drafter.
    rationale
        Recorded in ``meta.json`` as why this version exists.
    feedback
        Optional maintainer guidance, injected into the draft prompt as a subordinated block
        and recorded in ``meta.json`` as provenance.
    rulebook
        The draft-instruction template (a rulebook version's text) to draft from. ``None`` uses the
        built-in :data:`acumen.prompts.DRAFT_PROMPT`, so a plain ``acumen draft`` is unchanged; the
        rulebook loop passes a versioned template so the skill is drafted from the rulebook on trial.
    log
        A :class:`LiveLog` to stream the agent's messages to and render an HTML log from.

    Returns
    -------
    The drafted skill, loaded and validated.
