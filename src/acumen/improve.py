"""The improving agent: read train evidence, write ``skills/v{n+1}/``.

Where the drafter reads the package *source* to write the first skill, the improver
reads how the current skill *performed* — on the TRAIN split only — and edits it. Versions
are immutable: ``improve`` always writes a new directory, never mutates an existing one.

The load-bearing constraint is that the improver must never see test results, or the whole
benchmark is worthless. This is enforced two ways, not one:

1. **Structurally.** The agent's ``cwd`` is a throwaway work dir and its readable material
   is a *curated copy* of train-split runs. The real ``runs/`` tree is not on its ``cwd``,
   not in ``add_dirs``, and not in scope — so there is no test directory to reach in the
   first place.
2. **Belt-and-braces.** A ``PreToolUse`` hook denies any tool call whose path resolves under
   a ``runs/*/test/`` subtree, so even a call that names an absolute path back into the
   project runs tree is refused. See :func:`find_test_access`.

Prompt-level instruction alone is explicitly *not* sufficient.
