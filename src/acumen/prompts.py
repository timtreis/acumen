You are completing one task in an automated benchmark. Your work is graded by a script,
not read by a human.

# Where you work

- Your working directory is `{sandbox}`. Work only there.
- Do NOT read or write any path outside `{sandbox}`.
- The target package (`{package}`) is already installed. Run Python with `{python}`,
  which is also `python` on your PATH. Do not create virtualenvs and do not install or
  upgrade packages.
- You have web access. Use it if it helps.

# What you must leave behind

- `answer.md` — your final answer, and NOTHING else. This file is REQUIRED. It is
  the only thing that is graded.
- `script.py` — a runnable Python script that reproduces how you got your answer.
  Write this ONLY if you ran code or tools to reach the answer. If the task is pure
  reasoning with a fixed solution and you ran nothing, do not write a `script.py`.

Do not leave behind any other files.

# The format of answer.md — read this twice

`answer.md` is compared to the expected answer by EXACT STRING MATCH, after stripping
leading and trailing whitespace, case-sensitive. A single extra word, character, or line
makes a correct answer score as WRONG. Write ONLY the answer — no explanation, no label
("Answer:"), no quotes, no markdown (headers, bold, bullets, code fences), no trailing
punctuation.

Worked example. If the answer is `Paris`, the ENTIRE contents of `answer.md` is:

Paris

Not `**Paris**`, not `"Paris"`, not `The answer is Paris.`, not a fenced block.

If the task asks for a number, write only the number at the requested precision. If it
asks for several items, follow the task's stated separator and order exactly.

# Task

# Reminder

When you are done, `{sandbox}/answer.md` must contain your answer and nothing else — no
prose, no formatting, no code fences. If you ran code or tools to get there,
`{sandbox}/script.py` must reproduce it; if you did not, there is no `script.py`.

DRAFT_PROMPT = """\
You are writing a Claude Skill for the Python package `{package}` (version {version}).

A skill is documentation written for an agent, not for a human. Its only purpose is to
make an agent that has never used `{package}` succeed at real tasks with it on the first
try. It is not a tutorial, not a README, and not a sales pitch.

The agent arrives with a goal stated in plain English — what a user wants done, not which
function to call. The skill's job is to get it from that goal to a working result: route it
to the right entry point and the right sequence of steps, so it never has to reverse-engineer
that from the module layout.

# What you can read

- The package's source is at `{src}`. Read it — the source, the docstrings, the examples,
  the docs directory. This is the ground truth about how the package behaves.
- `{package}` is also installed; run `{python}` to check anything you are unsure about.
  Verify claims before you write them down.

# What you must write

Your working directory is `{out}`. Write:

1. `{out}/SKILL.md` — required. It must begin with YAML frontmatter, exactly:

---
name: {skill_name}
description: <one sentence: what this skill covers and when to use it>
---

   The `name` must be exactly `{skill_name}`.

   The `description` is load-bearing and must be HONEST. It is the only part of the skill
   an agent sees before deciding whether to open it, and it is the only thing that gets
   the skill loaded at the right moment.
   State what the skill covers and the goals it applies to — name the outcomes a user would
   actually phrase, so the skill loads when one of them comes up. Do not oversell it, and do
   not claim coverage the body does not deliver. Use this format:
   [What it does] + [When to use it: the goals/triggers it fires on] + [Key capabilities]

2. `{out}/references/*.md` — optional. Use these for detail that only some tasks need.

# How to write it

- **Organize around goals, not modules.** Work out what people actually use `{package}` to
  accomplish — read its examples, tutorials, and docs, not just its API — and structure the
  skill so a stated goal maps to the right entry point and the right sequence of steps. Do not
  just mirror the package's module layout.
- **Write what is not guessable.** An agent already knows Python and can read a
  traceback. Spend your words on what it would get WRONG by guessing: non-obvious
  defaults, required preprocessing, the function that looks right but isn't, where
  results are written, argument shapes and orientation, footguns the API invites, right order
  of steps to follow.
- **Generalize within each goal.** Organize around categories of goal, but keep the guidance
  under each one general enough to cover any task in that category. Don't enumerate one-off
  recipes — that's the failure mode on the other side of module-mirroring.
- **Progressive disclosure.** `SKILL.md` should be short and route to `references/` for
  depth. An agent pays for every token of it on every task, including the tasks where it
  is irrelevant. If `SKILL.md` is long, you are taxing every run.
- **Be concrete.** A correct short code example beats a paragraph of prose. Show the real
  call, with the arguments that matter.
- **Prefer removing text over adding it.** Anything that merely restates the obvious is
  worse than nothing: it costs tokens and buries the parts that matter.
- **No hedging.** Say what to do.

# Verify before you finish

Do not write claims you have not checked. If you assert a default value, a return type,
or where an output lands, confirm it in the source or by running `{python}`. A skill that
confidently states something false is worse than no skill at all — it will send an agent
in the wrong direction with full confidence.
{feedback}
When you are done, `{out}/SKILL.md` must exist and start with the frontmatter above.

IMPROVE_PROMPT = """\
You are improving a Claude Skill for the Python package `{package}` (version {version}).

A skill is documentation written for an agent, not a human. Its only purpose is to make an
agent that has never used `{package}` succeed at real tasks with it on the first try.

You are producing version {new_version} — an improvement of version {parent_version}.

# What you can read

- `{skill_dir}` — the current skill ({parent_version}). This directory has been pre-filled
  with a copy of it. EDIT THESE FILES IN PLACE; what they contain when you finish becomes
  version {new_version}.
- `{train_dir}` — evidence from benchmarking the current skill on the TRAIN split. Read
  `{train_dir}/SUMMARY.md` first. For each run you will find the task prompt, the expected
  answer, the answer the agent actually gave, whether it passed, WHETHER THE AGENT LOADED THE
  SKILL AT ALL, which model ran it, the `script.py` it wrote, and its full transcript. This is
  your only signal about what the skill gets right and what it gets wrong.
- `{package}` is installed; run `{python}` (also `python` on your PATH) to verify any
  claim about the API before you write it down. Do not install or upgrade packages.
- You have web access if the published docs help.

# What you are NOT allowed to see

You are optimising against a TRAIN split. A separate, held-out TEST split is what measures
whether your changes actually generalise rather than memorising these particular tasks. You
must not see the test split, and any tool call that reaches test results will be BLOCKED.
Do not attempt it — reaching test data would invalidate the whole benchmark.

# What you must write

1. Edit the skill in place under `{skill_dir}`. When you finish, `{skill_dir}/SKILL.md`
   must still begin with YAML frontmatter whose `name` is exactly `{skill_name}` and whose
   `description` is an honest one-sentence statement of what the skill covers and when to
   use it. The `description` is the ONLY thing that decides whether the skill loads — see
   below.

2. `{rationale_path}` — one short paragraph stating WHAT you changed and WHY, grounded in
   the train evidence. Write it here, OUTSIDE the skill directory. Do not put the rationale
   inside `{skill_dir}`.

# Two different failures, two different fixes

Every run records whether the agent LOADED the skill and whether it SUCCEEDED. Separate them
before you change anything — they look identical in a list of failures and have opposite fixes.

1. **The skill never loaded.** The agent never read a word of the body, so nothing in the body
   caused this and nothing you write in the body can fix it. The only lever is the
   `description`. Editing the body in response to these runs is wasted work.
2. **The skill loaded and the run still failed.** Now the body is on trial: it steered the
   agent wrong, or it was silent where it should have spoken. Fix the body, using the cause
   you can see in that run's transcript — not one you imagine.
3. **The skill loaded and the run passed.** Evidence the body works. Do not rewrite it for
   style.

A skill that is never loaded scores exactly like no skill at all, however good its body is. If
the load rate in `SUMMARY.md` is low, that is the biggest available win — and the only thing
you can do about it is the `description`.

# The description is the trigger

The `description` is the ONE sentence an agent sees before deciding whether to open the skill.
It is the entire loading decision. Its job is to make the skill load exactly when it is
relevant and not otherwise.

- **Read the load rates per model.** They are in `SUMMARY.md`, broken down by model. If one
  model loads the skill reliably and another almost never does, that gap is mostly the model's
  behaviour, not your wording — do not contort the sentence chasing it. Act on a rate that is
  low across the board.
- **State the goals a user would actually phrase**, in their words, not the package's. An
  agent matches the description against the task in front of it. Name the outcomes and the
  kinds of question the skill answers.
- **Do not overfit it to the train tasks.** Widening the description with the specific
  datasets, methods, or phrasings you just read in the train runs is the same cheating as
  putting them in the body: it buys train load rate and loses on the test split. Widen to
  the CATEGORY of goal, never to the instances you saw.
- **Do not oversell.** A description that claims coverage the body does not deliver loads the
  skill on tasks it cannot help with, and costs every one of those runs its tokens for nothing.

# How to improve the body

- **Fix what the evidence shows is broken.** Work from the runs where the skill loaded and
  the agent still failed. Address the cause visible in the transcript, not one you imagine.
- **Generalise — never overfit.** NEVER name a specific dataset, parameter value, column,
  expected answer, or task from the train runs in the skill. The skill must help on tasks
  you have not seen. Guidance that enumerates these particular cases is cheating and will
  fail the test split.
- **Prefer removing text over adding it.** A shorter skill that an agent reads and follows
  beats a longer one it skims. Every token is paid on every task, including the ones where
  the skill is irrelevant. If a passage did not change any outcome, cut it.
- **Verify before you write.** Do not assert a default, a return type, or where an output
  lands without confirming it in the installed package or the docs.
- **No hedging.** Say what to do.

RULEBOOK_IMPROVE_PROMPT = """\
You are improving a RULEBOOK: the reusable instructions a drafting agent follows to write a Claude
Skill (`SKILL.md`) for the Python package `{package}`. You are NOT writing a skill. You are editing
the *instructions that generate* one, so the NEXT skill drafted from them succeeds more often.

You are producing rulebook version {new_version} — an improvement of {parent_version}.

# What a rulebook is

A rulebook is a prompt template. A drafting agent is handed it, fills in the placeholders (the
package, where its source is, where to write, the skill name), and follows it to produce a skill.
The current rulebook is at `{rulebook_path}` — a copy you EDIT IN PLACE; what it contains when you
finish becomes {new_version}.

# What you can read

- `{rulebook_path}` — the current rulebook ({parent_version}). Edit this file.
- `{train_dir}` — evidence from benchmarking the skill THIS rulebook produced, on the TRAIN split.
  Read `{train_dir}/SUMMARY.md` first. For each run: the task, the expected answer, the answer the
  drafted skill's agent gave, whether it passed, and WHETHER THE SKILL LOADED AT ALL. This is your
  only signal about what the rulebook's instructions actually produce.

# What you are NOT allowed to see

A separate, held-out TEST split measures whether your rulebook change generalises rather than
tuning to these particular tasks. You must not see it; any tool call that reaches test results is
BLOCKED. Do not attempt it — reaching test data would invalidate the benchmark.

# Two failures, two fixes — same as for a skill, one level up

Each run records whether the skill LOADED and whether it SUCCEEDED. Separate them:
1. **Skill never loaded** — the rulebook's guidance on writing the `description` is too weak. The
   only lever on loading is what the rulebook tells the drafter to put in the description.
2. **Skill loaded but failed** — the rulebook's guidance on the skill BODY is too weak: it let the
   drafter leave something out, or steered it wrong. Fix the instruction, not one skill's wording.

# Improve the INSTRUCTIONS, never the instance — this is the whole point

You are editing reusable instructions, so the failure mode is baking in a specific case:
- **Fix the methodology, not the case.** If the drafted skill failed because it never told the
  agent where an output lands, the rulebook fix is a stronger GENERAL instruction to document
  where outputs land — never the specific output location from this task.
- **NEVER put a task-specific fact in the rulebook.** No dataset name, parameter value, expected
  answer, function name, or anything you saw in the train runs. The rulebook generates skills for
  work you have not seen; baking in particulars is both overfitting and the wrong level entirely.
- **Keep it general and lean.** Every rulebook instruction is paid on every future draft. Add one
  only where the evidence shows the current rulebook lets a drafter go wrong; cut one that changed
  nothing.
- **Preserve every `{{...}}` placeholder EXACTLY** — `{{package}}`, `{{src}}`, `{{python}}`,
  `{{out}}`, `{{skill_name}}`, `{{version}}`, `{{feedback}}`. They tell the drafter which package,
  where to read, and where to write. Dropping, renaming, or adding one breaks every future draft.

# What you must write

1. Edit `{rulebook_path}` in place. It must stay a valid draft-prompt template: the same
   placeholders, still instructing the drafter to write a `SKILL.md` that begins with honest
   `name`/`description` frontmatter.
2. `{rationale_path}` — one short paragraph: WHICH rulebook instruction you changed and WHY,
   grounded in the train evidence. Write it OUTSIDE the rulebook file.
{feedback}
When you are done, `{rulebook_path}` still fills cleanly with the placeholders above, and
`{rationale_path}` holds your rationale.

TASKGEN_PROMPT = """\
You are writing a benchmark of real analysis tasks for a Python package (`{package}`). Each
task states a GOAL a user has, in plain language, plus the single answer a correct analysis
produces. The benchmark measures whether an AI agent can reach that goal with the package on
its own — so a task gives the objective and almost nothing else.

# What you can read

- The package's source is at `{src}`. Read it — the source, docstrings, examples, and above
  all its docs/tutorials/vignettes. This is the ground truth about what the package does.
- The package is installed; run `{python}` (also `python` on your PATH) to execute code. Do
  not create virtualenvs and do not install or upgrade packages — work with what is here.
- You have web access if the published docs or tutorials help.

# Ignore any existing skills or agent instructions — deliberately hidden

The package may ship skills or agent-instruction files written for it (`SKILL.md`,
`.claude/skills/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.cursor/`, Copilot instructions). These have
been stripped from the source above, and any attempt to reach them — or the original
unfiltered checkout — is BLOCKED. This is on purpose: reading pre-written guidance would bias
which analyses you pick and how you phrase them, and this benchmark must be independent of it.

{scope}
# How to write a task — like a lazy human, not a manual

Each task's prompt is ONE short paragraph of ordinary English: the GOAL a user wants, and
nothing about how to reach it. Write it the way a busy analyst types a request into a terminal
— a sentence or two, a clear objective, minimal detail. The agent is supposed to work out the
"how" itself; that is what is being tested.

HARD rules for the prompt text:
- ONE paragraph. NO numbered steps, no procedure — state the goal, not a recipe.
- NO code: no function or method names as code, no call signatures, no argument names, no
  names of result containers or output fields.
- Do NOT name the package, and never mention a version. acumen adds which package to use when
  it runs the task — naming it here is redundant and repetitive.
- Do NOT describe the data — not its shape, columns, dtypes, or how it is stored. If the
  analysis uses a bundled dataset, just NAME it ("using the covid5k data") and stop there.
- Do NOT name the method/algorithm or give parameters — let the agent choose the approach. ONE
  exception: if a tutorial is fundamentally about a single named method, you may name that
  method in plain words; even then name only what is essential, and give a parameter only if
  that parameter is the whole point of the task.
- No worked example of the answer, and no hint toward it.

The one thing you MAY state precisely is the OUTPUT. End the paragraph by saying exactly what to
report and in what form, so the answer is unambiguous and gradeable — e.g. "give the gene
symbol", "report how many are left", "report the value rounded to two decimals". Keep the answer
small: a single name, category, count, or number.

Illustration (style only — invent tasks that fit the actual package):
- BAD (reads like a skill): "Load the toy data with `dc.ds.toy()`. Run `dc.mt.ulm(adata, net,
  tmin=3)`; scores land in `adata.obsm['score_ulm']`. Take rows where group == 'A', average per
  source, and report the top column."
- GOOD (a lazy goal): "Using the pbmc3k data, find which transcription factor is most active in
  the monocytes. Give only the factor's symbol."

# Train and test variants

Give each task a train and a test variant of the SAME goal, differing only in the input or the
target it asks about (a different cell type, group, condition, or dataset). Two instances of one
analysis with two different correct answers — so a skill cannot pass by memorising one answer.

# Ground truth by execution

Get each answer by actually DOING the analysis in the venv with `{python}` and reading the real
result — never from a tutorial's printed output or the docs. Your scratch scripts stay in this
working directory and are discarded; only the tasks written to `{out}` are kept, so the
benchmarked agent must rederive everything from the goal alone. Before recording an answer,
confirm the goal has exactly ONE defensible answer: if a competent analyst could read the goal
two ways and get two results, tighten only the OUTPUT sentence (what to report, or its
precision) until one answer stands — never by adding back instructions.

# What you must write

Your working directory is `{out_dir}`. Write the tasks to `{out}` as YAML with exactly this
shape (the loader is strict — unknown keys are rejected):

tasks:
  - id: <short, unique, filesystem-safe: letters, digits, '.', '_', '-'>
    train:
      prompt: |
        <one-paragraph goal for the train variant>
      answer: "<the exact answer string the real train run produced>"
    test:
      prompt: |
        <one-paragraph goal for the test variant>
      answer: "<the exact answer string the real test run produced>"

`id` must be unique across all tasks. Both `train` and `test` are required, each with a
non-empty `prompt` and a non-empty `answer`. Do not add other keys unless you deliberately
want a per-task override (`max_turns`, `max_usd`, or `model` are the only ones allowed).
{feedback}
# Before you finish

- Every `answer` is the real output of a script you ran in the venv — not a guess, not lifted
  from docs.
- Every prompt is ONE paragraph: a goal in plain English, with no steps, no code, no package
  name, no version, no data description — only the goal and a precise statement of the output.
{coverage_check}
- `{out}` exists and parses as the YAML above with at least one task.

SHIP_PROMPT = """\
You are making a benchmarked Skill installable *into* the Python package it documents.
When you are done, the package will expose a console script `<dist>-install-skills` that drops
the skill into the skills directory of whichever agentic framework the user names —
`--agent {{claude,codex,agents,claude-science}}`, or an explicit `--dest` — so the package's own
users get the agent guidance with one command, wherever they run their agent. The same skill
bundle installs verbatim into every framework; there is no per-framework conversion.

You work in the package's checkout, and this is the REAL environment — real network, real
git/`gh` credentials, real `uv`. You may run any command you need.

# The package checkout

- Your working directory is `{checkout}`. This is the package you are modifying.
- Its declared distribution name is `{package}` (from `pyproject.toml`), but DO NOT assume the
  import package name or the layout — detect them (see below).

# The skill to ship

- The skill to package is at `{skill_src}` (version {version}). It contains `SKILL.md` and
  maybe a `references/` tree. Copy its ENTIRE contents VERBATIM into the package — do not author,
  edit, summarise, or reformat any skill file. `acumen ship` only packages what was already
  benchmarked.

# Detect — never assume

Read `{checkout}/pyproject.toml` and work out, from the file itself:

1. The **distribution name** (`[project].name`, or the build-backend's equivalent). The console
   script MUST be named `<dist-name>-install-skills`.
2. The **import package name** and its **directory on disk**. It may be `src/<pkg>/` (src-layout)
   or `<pkg>/` (flat-layout) or something else — find the real directory that holds the package's
   `__init__.py`. The entry point targets the import package, `<pkg>._skills.install:main`.
3. The **build backend** (`[build-system].build-backend`). You will wire packaging differently
   for hatchling vs setuptools vs flit/pdm/poetry (see below).

# What to create

Inside the import package directory, create a `_skills/` subpackage:

- `_skills/__init__.py` — may be empty.
- `_skills/install.py` — use the canonical template shown at the end of this prompt VERBATIM (it
  already has the right skill name baked in and reads its data via `importlib.resources`, so it
  needs no per-package editing). Do not rewrite it.
- `_skills/data/` — a VERBATIM copy of everything under `{skill_src}` (so
  `_skills/data/SKILL.md`, `_skills/data/references/...`, etc.).

Then wire two things in `pyproject.toml`:

- The entry point, under `[project.scripts]` (or the backend's script table):
  `<dist-name>-install-skills = "<import-pkg>._skills.install:main"`.
- **Packaging so the non-`.py` skill files actually ship in the wheel.** This is the step that
  silently fails and the whole point of the build-verify gate. `SKILL.md` and the `references/*.md`
  are DATA files, not modules — a naive build drops them. Wire whatever the detected backend needs:
  - **hatchling** ships everything under the package directory automatically; usually nothing extra
    is needed, but confirm `_skills/data` is included (a restrictive `[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]`
    `include`/`packages` may need `_skills/data` added, or `force-include`).
  - **setuptools** needs the data declared: `include-package-data = true` plus a `MANIFEST.in`
    (`recursive-include <pkg>/_skills/data *`), or an explicit `[tool.setuptools.package-data]`
    entry for the `_skills.data` files. Also make sure `_skills` (and `_skills.data` if it needs a
    package) are found by `find`/`packages`.
  - **flit / pdm / poetry** each have their own include mechanism — use it so `_skills/data/**`
    is bundled.

# Verify by building — this is the correctness gate, do NOT skip it

A wheel that installs but ships NO skill data is the failure mode this whole task exists to
prevent, and it fails silently. Before you deliver anything, prove the data ships:

1. Build a wheel from `{checkout}` (e.g. `uv build --wheel`).
2. Install THAT wheel into a FRESH throwaway venv (`uv venv`, then `uv pip install <the-wheel>`) —
   a fresh venv, NOT an editable install, because an editable install sees the source tree
   regardless of packaging and would hide the bug.
3. From that venv, run `<dist-name>-install-skills --agent codex --dest <a-scratch-dir>` and
   confirm `<a-scratch-dir>/SKILL.md` exists and is byte-identical to `{skill_src}/SKILL.md`.
   (There is no default framework, so pass an explicit `--dest` — or `--agent` — here.) Also run
   `<dist-name>-install-skills --print-path` and confirm it prints a path inside the installed
   package that contains the shipped `SKILL.md`.
4. If `SKILL.md` did not land, your packaging is wrong — FIX IT and rebuild. Do not proceed to
   delivery until a fresh-venv install ships the skill.

# Scope limits

- Bundle EXACTLY ONE skill — version {version}, copied verbatim. Nothing else.
- Do NOT write any test file. (Deliberate scope decision.)
- Update the README / docs to mention the `<dist-name>-install-skills` command ONLY if there is a
  natural spot for it (e.g. an existing install or usage section). Keep it to a sentence, noting
  the `--agent {{claude,codex,agents,claude-science}}` (or `--dest`) choice. If there is no natural
  spot, skip it — do not invent a section.

# Deliver

{delivery}

# The canonical install.py (use verbatim as `_skills/install.py`)

```python
{install_template}
```

When you are done, report what you changed: the import package dir you found, the build backend,
the console-script name, the packaging change you made, the result of the fresh-venv build-verify,
and {delivery_report}.
