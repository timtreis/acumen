"""Generational rulebook evolution: improve-from-best, cheap screens, a confirmed ratchet.

The CV loop (:mod:`acumen.loop`) measures one improvement step honestly but costs ~a session window
per iteration, and both live rounds showed its chain walking *through* regressions (iteration 2
improved from a version that was already worse out of sample). This module trades per-decision
certainty for decision volume — the shape of an autoresearch run with hundreds of generations:

* **Improve from the best, always.** Every generation's improve agent starts from the current
  champion and its failure evidence, never from a regressed child. Rejected candidates keep their
  version directories (provenance) but nothing descends from them.
* **Wild exploration.** Each generation carries a rotating *directive* (:data:`DIRECTIVES`) injected
  as maintainer feedback — bold restructures, aggressive deletion, inversion of an assumption —
  so the search tries large moves, not only one-more-bullet edits.
* **Two-tier selection.** A generation is scored on a small rotating **screen** subset (cheap,
  noisy, allowed to be wrong); a screen win only makes the candidate the *screen champion*. The
  **confirmed champion** — the version improvement builds from permanently — only changes after a
  full held-out bench (every ``confirm_every`` accepts), and a failed confirmation reverts the
  screen champion. Screen decisions may thrash; the ratchet may not.
* **Archive everything.** Every generation appends one JSON line (directive, versions, subset,
  scores, decision) to ``runs/evolve.jsonl`` — hundreds of recorded accept/reject decisions are the
  dataset a cross-pollination step mines for edits that replicate across independent islands.
* The **lockbox** stays write-once and is opened once at the very end (champion and seed, each over
  ``n_drafts`` independent drafts) — screens and confirmations never touch it.

Everything resumes by file presence and *determinism*: the directive, screen subset, and candidate
version of generation ``g`` are pure functions of ``(g, seed)``, so a resumed run replays every
decision from on-disk scores without spawning an agent for finished work.

       test = the score the candidate must beat; both mostly cached within an epoch).
    2. Improve the rulebook **from the screen champion** under :func:`directive_for`'s directive
       (composed with the caller's ``feedback``), into version ``v{g+1}``; draft one skill from it.
    3. Bench the candidate on the subset's test split; **accept** (candidate becomes screen
       champion) iff it beats the champion by ``accept_delta`` passes on the identical subset.
    4. Every ``confirm_every`` accepts, bench the screen champion on the FULL task set's test split
       and compare with the confirmed champion's full bench: strictly more passes promotes it;
       anything else reverts the screen champion to the confirmed one. Pending accepts are
       confirmed the same way once the generation budget or wall-clock stops the run.

    ``accept_delta`` exists because the screen is noisy by construction (12-ish tasks, one draft):
    it should be set from measured draft variance, not hope — a screen win smaller than the noise
    floor must not even challenge.
